# Cancer Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project aims to uncover insights into cancer incidence and related factors by analyzing a comprehensive dataset. Exploring patterns, trends, and insights to better understand the distribution and determinants of cancer across different populations. The analysis begins with data filtering and preparation in PostgreSQL, followed by detailed analysis in R.

## Data Preparation

The initial dataset, "U.S._Chronic_Disease_Indicators__CDI_" undergoes preliminary filtering and preparation using SQL queries in PostgreSQL. This step ensures the extraction of relevant subsets of data for further analysis.

## SQL Filtering Steps:

Selection of relevant columns for analysis.
Filtering based on specific criteria (e.g., year, geography, demographics).
Exporting the filtered dataset for analysis in R.

## Features
Cancer Incidence Analysis: Examination of cancer incidence rates across various demographics and regions.
Data Visualization: Use of charts and graphs to illustrate trends and patterns.

## Tools and Technologies
PostgreSQL: For initial data filtering and preparation.
R for Data Analysis: Data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
RStudio: Script development and project management.
Git/GitHub: Version control and repository hosting.
